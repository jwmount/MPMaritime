desc = "Vessels nominally sized around 10,000 cbm. 
        <p>\n\nEthane is produced on an industrial scale from natural gas, and as a by-product of petroleum refining. Global ethane production was estimated at 55 million tons in 2013, the overwhelming majority in the Middle East and US.
        <p>The primary use of ethane is in the chemical industry in the production of ethylene, which in turn is used to produce polyethylene, PVC, ethylene glycol and styrene.
        <p>Historically, ethane has been transported in small liquefied ethane/ethylene carriers (LECs) designed and constructed to carry ethylene (boiling point -104Â°C) as well as ethane and other <i>normal</i> LPG cargoes. Currently there are only 29 LECs larger than 10,000 cbm, with the largest having a capacity of 22,000 cbm.
